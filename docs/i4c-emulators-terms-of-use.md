# CORDEX-CMIP6 Terms of Use

To enable modeling groups and others who support CORDEX-CMIP6 to demonstrate its impact (and secure ongoing funding), you are required to cite and acknowledge those who have made CORDEX-CMIP6 possible.
You also must abide by any licensing restrictions.
Specifically, you must

 * Adhere to any licensing restrictions defined by the CORDEX modeling groups.
   CORDEX strongly recommends to use the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license ([CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)) but other more restrictive licenses can also be used depending on the CORDEX modeling group.
   **The registered CORDEX-CMIP6 models and respective license information are available from the [CORDEX-CMIP6 model list](https://wcrp-cordex.github.io/cordex-cmip6-cv/CORDEX-CMIP6_source_id.html)**.
 * Include in publications an acknowledgment with language similar to:
   > We acknowledge the World Climate Research Programme, the CORDEX Science Advisory Team (SAT) - coordinating body of CORDEX, and the Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) - responsible panel for CMIP6.
   > We thank the CORDEX climate modeling groups for producing and making available their model output, CMIP6 for providing the driving data, the Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) for archiving the data and providing access, and the multiple funding agencies who support CORDEX, CMIP6 and ESGF.

The CORDEX-CMIP6 archive contains the output of scientific simulations of the past and potential future that are subject to multiple sources of error, ranging from errors in data handling, to errors in the representation of the real world in either the model, or the experimental setup for which the model was used.
Different parts of the CORDEX-CMIP6 archive may be subject to differing levels of such errors, and users should be alert to these issues, and their potential consequences (and to the limitations of liability expressed in the data license). 

The data producers and data providers make no warranty, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose.
All liabilities arising from the supply of the information (including any liability arising in negligence) are excluded to the fullest extent permitted by law.
